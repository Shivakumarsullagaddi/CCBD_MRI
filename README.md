**learnings :**
>3D images needs more compution (GPUs) TAKES MORE TIME WITH CPU</br>

>Whenever Dataset is SMALL and model is Overfitting : use DATA AGUMENTATION ,REGULARZIATION

>Whenever problem with Genralization : use Transfer Learning

>Whenever problem in loading huge dataset ,while training in GPU : use mixed Precision

>When all good : Try to change and observe epoch,batch size,learning rate
